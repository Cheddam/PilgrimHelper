# PilgrimHelper

An app to manage rounds of [Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Card Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdw8muiruZU).

This project is my attempt to learn Swift and iOS development. As such, it's full of rough edges and doesn't feel particularly native yet. I intend to polish the interface (and code structure) over time.


### Backlog

- Implement contraints so the UI looks correct on iPhones outside the 6-8 series
- Use a proper Navigation Bar object for native feel and to allow shifting between views
- Customise segue animations to slide new views in from the right like normal apps (might not be necessary once the Navbar is implemented?)
